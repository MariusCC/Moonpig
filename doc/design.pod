=head2 Basic entities

=head3 Ledger

A ledger wraps up an account history.  It contains the entire history
number of piggy banks, consumers, and invoices.  It also singles out
the currently-active piggy banks and consumers, the current "general
fund" piggy bank, if there is one, and the current invoice.  It also
contains contact information for the account.

=head3 Contact

Email addresses, postal addresses, credit card numbers (or proxies for
credit card numbers.)

=head3 Invoice

An invoice represents list of unpaid charges that the owner of the
account will be asked to pay.  Its implementation is as the head of a
cost tree.  An invoice can be frozen, at which time the unpaid charges
from any outstanding invoices are inserted into its cost tree.   Then
it can be asked to produce printable representations of itself, which
can then be mailed out.

The printable representations may decide, at each level of the cost
tree, to present a single subtotal item, or descend the tree to the
next level to list the sub-items.

=head3 Piggy bank

A piggy bank represents a credit received by a customer, typically
because they sent us money, but perhaps because.  A piggy bank may be
associated with a particular consumer, or may be a "general fund", not
associated with any consumer but available to any consumer whose
associated piggy bank is insufficient to cover its demands.

The piggy bank keeps track of its initial funds.  The latter amount is
the amount that has already been "used up" by paying for services.
When a new charge is created, a transfer item is created at the same
time that records the transfer from the piggy bank.

A piggy bank may be marked as refundable or non-refundable.
Refundable credits result from cash payments; the user can ask for
their cash back, and receives a corresponding proration of service.  A
non-refundable credit might result from a consolation prize given to
the user for a service failure, or might represent a service that we
refuse to prorate, or that we cannot prorate, such as domain
registration.

=head3 Consumer

A consumer represents a service for which a consumer pays.  At present
there appear to be three sorts: periodically assessed services;
pay-as-you-go services, and pay-once services.  Periodically, the
service object will decide that it needs to collect a payment.  Each
consumer has a target piggy bank from which it draws funds.  It will
ask the piggy bank if the bank has sufficient funds.  If so, it will
create a charge and a transaction that transfers the correct amount of
money from the piggy bank to the charge.  If there are not sufficient
funds, it is responsible for issuing appropriate warnings to the use
and eventually for cutting off service.

A service such as listbox posting can ask a consumer if its banks are
sufficiently well-funder, and can deny service if not.

=head3 Charge

A charge represents a certain amount of service that we have provided,
reducing our debit to the customer by a certain amount.  It has a
consumer (the service that required the charge) and a piggy bank (the
prepayment from which the charged amount was taken)

=head3 Cost tree

Charges are assmebled into cost trees.  A cost tree node is either a
charge or a rollup node which collects together several charges and
cost trees.  For example, consider a user with a pobox account and
a listbox account.  At the end of the month, their cost tree might
look like this:

     root --- pobox account ---  1 Oct 2011 charge: $ .05479
                            ---  2 Oct 2011 charge: $ .05479
                            ...
                            --- 31 Oct 2011 charge: $ .05479

          --- listbox acct  --- Setup fee : $15.00
                            --- mailings --- post #12345 : $17.30
                                         --- post #7890a : $17.225


The organization of the cost tree allows the invoice to present the
charges the way we want:

	Pobox account:
	  October		$ 1.70

	Listbox account:
	  Setup fee		$15.00
	    (setup credit)     ($15.00)

	  Posts:                $17.30  692 deliveries, Oct 18
                                $17.23  689 deliveries, Oct 29

	  Subtotal              $34.53

	TOTAL                   $36.23

=head3 Transaction

Do we really need this?

=head2 Examples

At present there appear to be three sorts of consumers:

=head3 Periodically assessed services

For example, A Pobox account costs $20 per year.  We will assess this
as a $20/12 payment per month.  (Or possibly a $20/365 payment per
year?)  Each day the consumer object will receive a heartbeat event.
It will check if it has processed a charge yet this month.  If not, it
will try to process a charge against its piggy bank.  If the piggy
bank is sufficiently well-funded, that is all that is needed; the
charge is now in the right cost tree and the later invoice will inform
the customer.

If the piggy bank is not well-enough funded, the account will check to
see if there is a general fund piggy bank from which it can draw.
If not, it will check to see if there is

=head3 Pay-as-you-go services

=head3 Pay-once services
