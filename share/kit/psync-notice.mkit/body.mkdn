You've recently updated your service {{ $consumer->xid }}.
Due to those changes, your account price has decreased.

Your account was due to expire after {{ $old_expiration_date->strftime($date_format) }}.  Because of the lower
rate, it will now expire on {{ $new_expiration_date->strftime($date_format) }} instead.

This message is for your information only. You need take no further
action.
