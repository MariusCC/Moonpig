REQUEST ID: ...

You've recently updated your service {{ $consumer->xid }}.
Due to those changes, your account price has decreased.

Your account was due to expire after {{
  $consumer->replacement_chain_expiration_date({
     include_expected_funds => 0 })->iso }}.  Because of the lower
  rate, it will now expire on 
{{$consumer->replacement_chain_expiration_date({
    include_expected_funds => 1 })->iso }} instead.

This message is for your information only. You need take no further
action.
